## Polymarket Mental Models

### Events, Markets and Outcomes

The Polymarket ecosystem is organized hierarchically:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A([Event]) --- B([Market A])
    A --- C([Market B])
    A ~~~ Dot1@{ shape: sm-circ}
    A ~~~ Dot2@{ shape: sm-circ}
    A ~~~ Dot3@{ shape: sm-circ}
    A -.- D([Market n])
    B --- E([Outcome 1])
    B --- F([Outcome 2])
    C --- G([Outcome 1])
    C --- H([Outcome 2])
```

- **Event** — represents a proposition or question such as “How many Fed rate cuts in 2025?”.  
  - Identified by a human-readable **`slug`** (e.g. `how-many-fed-rate-cuts-in-2025`) and an **event `id`** (e.g. `16085`).

- **Market** — represents a specific option for the related event (e.g. 1 rate cut in 2025). An Event has 1 or more corresponding Markets. (e.g. 9 options in this case - {0, 1, 2, ..., 7, 8 or more} rate cuts in 2025)
  - Identified by a **`condition id`** (e.g. `0x8e9b6942b4dac3117dadfacac2edb390b6d62d59c14152774bb5fcd983fc134e` for 1 rate cut in 2025), a human-readable **`slug`** (e.g. `'will-1-fed-rate-cut-happen-in-2025'`) and a **market `id`** (e.g. `516724`).

- **Outcome** — represents a binary option related to a market. (most commonly `Yes`/`No`, but can be e.g. `Paris Saint-Germain`/`Inter Milan` in the case of a match where draws are not possible)
  - Identified by a **`token id`** (e.g. `15353185604353847122370324954202969073036867278400776447048296624042585335546` for the `Yes` outcome in the 1 rate cut in 2025 market)

- The different APIs represent Events/Markets differently (e.g. Event, QueryEvent / ClobMarket, GammaMarket, RewardsMarket) but they all use to the same underlying identifiers.


### Tokens
- **Tokens** are the blockchain implementation of **Outcomes** - tradable digital assets on the Polygon blockchain that users buy, hold and sell on Polygon. 
- This helps ensure the logic of binary outcome prediction markets through smart contracts (e.g. collateralization, token prices going to $1.00 or $0.00 after resolution, splits/merges).

### Splits and Merges
- Holding 1 `Yes` share + 1 `No` share in a **Market** (e.g. `'will-1-fed-rate-cut-happen-in-2025'`) covers the entire universe of possibilities and guarantees a $1.00 payout regardless of outcome. This mathematical relationship enables Polymarket's core mechanisms: splitting (1 USDC → 1 `Yes` + 1 `No`) and merging (1 `Yes` + 1 `No` → 1 USDC) at any point before resolution.
- Splits are the only way tokens are created. Either a user splits USDC into equal shares of the complementary tokens or Polymarket automatically splits USDC when it matches an `Yes` buy order at e.g. 30¢ with a `No` buy order at 70¢.

### Unified Order Book
- Polymarket uses traditional exchange mechanics - a Central Limit Order Book (CLOB), where users place buy and sell orders that get matched by price and time priority.
- However, because the `Yes` and `No` outcomes form a complete probability universe, certain orders become mathematically equivalent - allowing the matching engine to find trades as exemplified above.
- This unified structure means every **BUY** order for `Outcome 1` at price **X** is simultaneously visible as a **SELL** order for `Outcome 2` at price **(100¢ - X)**, creating deeper liquidity and tighter spreads than separate order books would allow.

### Negative Risk and Conversions
- If the **Markets** in and **Event** collectively cover a complete universe of possibilities (e.g. {0, 1, 2, ..., 7, 8 or more} rate cuts in 2025) and only one winner is possible, two collections of positions (made up of tokens and USDC) become mathematically equivalent and the **Event** is said to support negative risk.
  - e.g. Hold 1 `No` token in the 0 rate cuts in 2025. This is equivalent to holding 1 `Yes` token in each of the other **Markets** {1, 2, ..., 7, 8 or more}.
- An interesting consequence is that holding `No` tokens in more than one **Market** is equivalent to `Yes` tokens ***and*** some USDC.
  - e.g. Hold 1 `No` token on each of {0, 1, 2, ..., 7, 8 or more} rate cuts in 2025. Because only one winner is possible, this guarantees that 8 out of the 9 **Markets** resolve to `No`. This is equivalent to a position of 8 USDC.
  - e.g. Hold 1 `No` token on each of {0, 1} rate cuts in 2025. This is equivalent to 1 `Yes` token in {2, ..., 7, 8 or more} and 1 USDC.
- Polymarket allows for the one way (for capital efficiency) conversion from `No` tokens to a collection of `Yes` tokens and USDC before resolution through a smart contract.
